# Sap-Lab-Hiring-Question

Milly is playing with an array A of size N. She is trying to find those non-empty subarrays (sequence of consecutive elements) 
whose maximum and minimum values are identical. Milly got confused while counting. Your task is to help her in this problem.

# Input     
First line of the input will contain T denoting the number of test-cases.     
For every test case, first line will contain N. Next line will contain N space separated integers denoting Ai.    

# Output      
For every test case, print the required answer in a separate line.    

# Constraints     
1 ≤ T ≤ 10      
1 ≤ N ≤ 105     
1 ≤ |Ai| ≤ 109      
Here, || denotes the absolute value.

# Sample Input
1       
3       
1 1 3

# Sample Output
